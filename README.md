# cse400perceptions
Code exploring the relationship between opinions and perceptions in social networks. 
This project is the culmination of an independent study by Samm Kaiser, a 4th year Math + Computer Science student at Washington University in Saint Louis,
under supervision by Yevgeniy (Eugene) Vorobeychik. We simulated how opinions and perceptions of opinions change in a social network. See Report.ipynb for 
more details on our methodology, results, and future questions. If you have any questions, feel free to email sammkaiser@wustl.edu.
